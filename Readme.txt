To get the sample to work you will need to enter your API Key, and Shared Secret.

You can permenantly set these by editing the Text property of the Textbox on the TemplateForm (for APiKey) and the AuthenticationForm (for SharedSecret).

For each action where authentication is required you must Authenticate each time to populate the AuthToken, or copy it from form to form.
